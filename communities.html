In order to combat against knife crime we have partnered up with some communities around London to help people who have been involved in such and are seeking help to get better, those who have lost a loved one to a knife incident, those who just want more information about how they can help and trying to get youths involved in clubs so that hey are in a positive environment learning new skills, working with others and putting their knowledge to good use.

Fight for change is a sport for development charity, using sport as a way to get young people and adults together. This includes boxing, martial arts and fitness training ensuring that these people put their skills to good use to work in teams and change their outlook on life.
