<h4>Knife crime: I'm living on the edge, says student.

​</h4>
          
<p>
  Young black men under the age of 25 are the group most likely to be victims of knife crime.

Speaking in simple statistical terms, they are also most likely to be prosecuted for knife crime.

​

It's a very real worry for the students of Newham Sixth Form College, who have organised an awareness day on the issue.

Each of them has been affected by knife crime or the threat of it in some way.

Clyde, 19, had a friend who was killed in a stabbing outside the McDonald's where he works nights.

​

"He was eating and chatting to me. He said goodbye and left, and then there was this fight outside. We were told to stay inside.

"When I came back the next day I heard that someone had been stabbed fatally and it was him. He was 23."

Clyde says: "Now I feel like I am living on the edge.

"It made me open my eyes more about how I should be aware of what's going on in my environment."

<h5>Knife crime: Number of offences at nine-year high

​</h5>          
    
<p>
  The Ministry of Justice reported a total of 21,484 offences in England and Wales, the equivalent of 59 every single day.

​

Of all those convicted or cautioned, just over a fifth were under 18.

The figures show 37% of all offences led to an immediate jail sentence, compared with 23% in 2009.

Cautions and fines are only half as likely to be used now as they were in 2009.

The average length of custodial sentences classed as "immediate" - therefore not including suspended sentences - was 8.1 months last year. That is the longest average term since comparable records began in 2008.

The MoJ figures cover not just knives, but other offensive weapons such as deliberately broken bottles, sharpened screwdrivers, knuckle dusters and corrosive liquids.

<h5>Knife crime: Are school exclusions to blame?

​</h5>
<p>Almost a quarter of children in England who said they had carried a knife in the previous year had been expelled or suspended from school. Only 3% of children who said they had not carried a knife had been excluded, according to government figures.

​

Police commissioners have written to Theresa May to warn that children who are excluded from school are at risk of being "sucked into criminality".

So are school exclusions driving a wave in youth crime?

There is certainly a close correlation between school exclusions and knife crime in young people. As one goes up, the other goes up and vice versa.

But this doesn't tell us that school exclusion in itself is causing knife crime. Other things have been increasing at the same time which could be driving both trends, including rising child poverty, mental ill health and rising numbers of children considered by local authority social services to be "in need".

​

In a 2017 report on rising school exclusions for centre-left think tank the Institute for Public Policy Research, researcher Kiran Gill said that rising exclusions could be partially explained by rising numbers of children with complex needs and vulnerabilities.
