  The 18-year-old was killed on 9 January 2015, but was already the third teenage victim of knife crime in London, after the deaths of Jeremie Malenge, 18, and Bilal Mirza, 17. Ekpaloba was close to his mother, the two even shared a bed until he was 12 years old. “He didn’t like to sleep alone,” his mother said. He was an aspiring rapper, known as Profit to his friends and his 1,000 Twitter followers, who toured in a play with the north London theatre company Chickenshed about the dangers of knife crime. Jaydee Dorsett, 20, murdered Ekpaloba in a “violent and sustained knife fight” at his flat in Wood Green after a botched robbery by Ekpaloba and an associate, a court heard in July. Grace accepts that her son made mistakes in his short life but said it was wrong to label his death as gang crime. “He wasn’t in a gang, he just made one bad friendship, as far as I can see,” she said. “He was painted in the media to be this horrible person, but he wasn’t, he was so kind and giving. If you felt down, he would give you one of those hugs where you could just melt into his arms.”

  17-year-old girl who was shot dead in London on Monday evening is understood to be Tanesha Melbourne. Friends and family spoke of their grief after news broke that the school student had been killed. She was with friends in Chalgrove Road, Tottenham, north London, when she was murdered shortly before 9.30pm on Monday. On the same evening a 16-year-old boy was shot in Walthamstow, north-east London, and is now in a critical condition. A woman who knew the murdered girl said the victim was "just chilling with her friends" when she was shot from a car for "no reason at all". "The car just pulled up and just started shooting," said the 21-year-old, who did not want to be named. She said she heard the gunshots "like fireworks" from her house.
